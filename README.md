Robust Task Management Application

TaskTrells is a full-featured todo list and task management application built with Flutter and GetX. It helps you stay organized by managing daily tasks, sub-tasks, and projects with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

# Key Features

- **Task Management:** Create, edit, and delete tasks with titles, descriptions, scheduled dates, and priority levels.
- **Sub-tasks:** Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that can be reordered. 
- **Kanban Board View:** Organize tasks into four distinct columns which can be reordered by dragging and dropping:
    - Todo: Tasks that are yet to be started.
    - In Progress: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
    - Done: Tasks that are completed once checked.
    - Overdue: Tasks that have missed their scheduled deadline.
- **Notifications & Reminders:** Set specific reminders for tasks with notification permissions.
- Data Persistence: Task data is stored locally using Hive, ensuring data safety and accessibility without internet.
- **Dynamic UI:** The UI updates dynamically to reflect task changes, such as marking a task as overdue or changing its priority.
